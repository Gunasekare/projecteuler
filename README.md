# Project Euler  
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website containing programming challenges that are more mathematically oriented. It is also one of the oldest websites in the competitive programming ring.
  
Often, the best solution is derived using an algorithm that has been optimized by using mathematical analysis as well as by employing techniques in Computer Science. This repository ontains my solutions to the problems that I have solved so far, primarily using ~~Common Lisp~~ C#.  
  
Disclaimer - the solutions are far from perfect.
